Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future

In this assignment, we will test the many time series tools that we have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen.

We will be using the following methods:

  * Time series forecasting: 
               
               matplotlib, Hodrick-Prescott filter, ARMA modelling, ARIMA modelling and GARCH modelling
  * Linear regression modelling: 
                
                tools from the Scikit-Learn linear regression model used on training vs testing data to evaluate their RMSE
    
Conclusions will be made of each model within the code
