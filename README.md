**Unit 10â€”A Yen for the Future**

In this assignment I will be using the following methods to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen:

  * Time series forecasting: 
               
               matplotlib, Hodrick-Prescott filter, ARMA modelling, ARIMA modelling and GARCH modelling
  * Linear regression modelling: 
                
                tools from the Scikit-Learn linear regression model used on training vs testing data to evaluate their RMSE
    
Conclusions will be made of each model within the code
